class Solution:
    def gcd(self, a : int, b : int) -> int:
        while (b!=0):
            temp=a%b
            a=b
            b=temp
        return a
        
        
Examples:

Input: a = 3, b = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: GCD of 3 and 6 is 3
Input: a = 1, b = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: GCD of 1 and 1 is 1
